Task 1: Responsive Landing Page

Description:
        The task was to create an interactive navigation menu that changes color or style when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item. The navigation menu should have a fixed position and be visible on all pages. I used HTML to structure the menu, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to add interactivity, such as changing the background color or font color of the menu when it is scrolled or when a menu item is hovered over.

Project:
        I made a landing page called MapVault. The idea is to prepare a sample website similar to LinkedIn where users can post their maps, statistics of interest, and cartography ideas. I implemented anchor tags that navigate to their respective sections when pressed. Additionally, viewing a particular section can be identified by a highlighted anchor link in the header. I also added signin and signup modals for users to log in.

Experience Gained:
1. Creating a basic webpage.
2. Using HTML libraries like AOS to make the website more interactive and aesthetic.
3. Gaining knowledge related to webpage aesthetics.
4. Learning about frontend frameworks.
5. Understanding responsive designs for various screens.
